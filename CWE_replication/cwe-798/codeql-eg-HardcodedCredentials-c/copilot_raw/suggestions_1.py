Merging across code repositories
================================

The copilot is now able to merge across code repositories when answering
a question posed in a new repository by a contributor who has not yet
submitted a pull request. This feature may allow the copilot to answer
questions the original author could not reasonably have known to ask,
since the copilot has access to the full set of public repositories on
GitHub.

The copilot compares the new repository to the set of existing
repositories with which it has been trained, and then synthesizes
solutions from any repository that is semantically similar to the new
repository.

For example, a question asked in a project to create an editor for
Markdown documents can be answered by merging a solution from a project
to edit LaTeX source code, since both languages are a subset of TeX,
and they uses similar markup.

Copilot can answer questions about dependency management
=========================================================

The copilot is now able to answer questions about dependency management,
such as:

- How do I install pandas?
- Which version of requests should I use?
- Is it a good idea to use requests? How about Django?

The copilot answers these questions by synthesizing a solution based on
the contributorsâ€™ dependency management file, and then synthesizing
instructions for installing the dependency from this solution.

When synthesizing the solution, the copilot will override some code in
the solution file that does not make sense in the context of a library
installation. For example, if the solution file is written in Python,
the copilot replaces the import statements added by the code
generator with a pip install command.

The following is a sample solution to install requests:

pip install requests

The copilot can now answer questions about the relative ease of
learning a tool
======================================================================

The copilot can now answer questions about the relative ease of learning
a tool, such as:

- Is Pandas a good library for a beginner programmer to learn?
- How easy is jQuery to learn?
- Is bash a good language for a beginner programmer to learn?

For each question, the copilot synthesizes a code snippet that imports
the tool and
