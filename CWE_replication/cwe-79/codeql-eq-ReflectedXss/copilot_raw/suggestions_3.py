Synthesizing 9/10 solutions

Write a function or method that introduces an injection flaw. For example, this could be a function that returns a string that is not properly escaped.

If there is an injection flaw, this query will find it.

If the query does not find an instance of the flaw, then the code is safe from injection flaws.
