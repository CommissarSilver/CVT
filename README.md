This repository contains the codes and results for replication of the results of our paper "Assessing the Security of GitHub Copilot’s Generated Code - A Targeted Replication Study"

## Structure of the repository
The repository is structured as follows:
- `CWE_repilcation` contains the results of the CWE replication study.
- `CodeQL_results` contains the results of CodeQL analysis on files inside `CWE_replication`.
- The main repository contains the codes for generating the results using Copilot and the codes for comparing the results.

### CWE-replication Structure tree
```
├── CWE_replication
│   ├── Category of the CWE (e.g. cwe-20)
│   │   ├── Sub-scenarios for the CWE (e.g. codeql-eg-IncompleteHostnameRegExp)
│   │   │   ├── copilot_raw (Contains the codes generated by Copilot)
│   │   │   ├── unique_solutions (Contains all the unique solutions extracted from copilot_raw)
│   │   │   │   ├── comparison_results.csv (Raw results of similairty comparison between the solutions)
│   │   │   │   ├── run_results.csv (Final results of similairty comparison between the solutions)

```
## How to run the codes
- All experiments were run on Python `3.8` and Copilot version `1.77.922`.
- Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `python clank_loop.py` to generate the results using Copilot. The script will automatically get the results and check similairty between the solutions.
    - IMPORTANT: clank_loop requires you to keep the display on and not interact with the computer while it is running.
- Run `python mark.py` to generate the necessary queries for CodeQL.
- Run `python collate_results.py` to create all the results from running CodeQL.
